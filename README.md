TryHackMe Phishing Pond write-up.

## 1. Introduction
This write-up documents the completion of the **TryHackMe “Phishing Pond”** room. The purpose of this lab is to improve awareness of phishing attacks by analyzing email examples and identifying common phishing indicators. The exercise will focus on how attackers use social engineering techniques to deceive users into clicking malicious links, downloading harmful attachments, or disclosing sensitive information.

## 2. Tools Used
The following tools and resources were used to complete this lab:

- TryHackMe Web Platform
- Web Browser
- Email Analysis Skills
- Critical Thinking and Observation
  
No additional software or command-line tools were required for this exercise.

## 3. Lab Objectives
The objectives of the Phishing Pond lab are:

- To understand how phishing emails are structured
- To identify common signs of phishing attacks
- To differentiate between legitimate and malicious emails
- To recognize social engineering techniques used by attackers
- To improve overall phishing awareness and detection skills

## 4. Room Overview
The Phishing Pond room presents a series of simulated email messages that reflect common real-world scenarios. Each email must be reviewed to determine whether it is legitimate or a phishing attempt.
The analysis is based on various indicators such as the sender’s email address, message content, tone, urgency, and any included links or attachments. This room emphasizes user awareness as a key defense against phishing attacks.

## 5. Task Walkthrough
The tasks in this room involve analyzing multiple email examples provided by the platform for each email. The user is required to decide whether the message is phishing or legitimate using crtical thinking, knowledge in phishing and observation. During the analysis, attention was given to the following indicators:

- Suspicious or unfamiliar sender addresses
- Urgent or threatening language
- Requests for personal or sensitive information
- Unexpected links or attachments
- Poor grammar or spelling errors

Each email was classified based on these observations.

- This email is identified as a phishing attempt because the link uses a deceptive domain designed to mimic a legitimate payment portal.

- This email is classified as a phishing attempt as it includes a malicious attachment and instructs the user to enable macros which is a common attack technique.

- This is identified as a phishing email because it contains a link that directs users to a credential-collecting page. 

## 6. Results
All tasks in the Phishing Pond room were completed successfully. Each email scenario was analyzed, and phishing attempts were accurately identified based on common social engineering indicators.
This exercise demonstrated how phishing emails can appear convincing and how careful inspection of message details can prevent users from falling victim to such attacks.

## 7. Key Learnings
Several key learning outcomes were achieved after completing the game and its associated challenges. These key learnings include the following:

- Phishing attacks rely on manipulating human behavior rather than exploiting technical vulnerabilities
- Urgency and fear are commonly used to pressure users into acting quickly
- Sender addresses and message context should always be verified
- Legitimate organizations do not request sensitive information via email
- User awareness is one of the most effective defenses against phishing attacks

## 8. Conclusion
The Phishing Pond room provided valuable insights into how phishing attacks are designed and executed. Through the analysis of multiple email examples, this lab enhanced the ability to identify common phishing indicators and better understand attacker techniques.This exercise highlights the importance of cybersecurity awareness and reinforces the critical role of informed users in preventing phishing-related incidents.
